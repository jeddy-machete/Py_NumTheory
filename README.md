A collection of funtions to compute some of the Number theory concepts that I've been studying.

For further reference on the matter, the titles that I've been studying for a few months are:
    - "An Introduction to The Theory of Numbers, 3rd ed.", by Niven and Zuckerman (thanks dad)
    - "Introduction to the Theory of Numbers", by Leonard Eugene Dickson

Most notably, I'm using this project to strengthen MY OWN understanding of the content material
